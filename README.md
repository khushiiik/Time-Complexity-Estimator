# Time Complexity Estimator

A web application built with Django to help users estimate the time complexity of their code. Users can input their function code, and the app will provide an estimated time complexity.

## Features

- Input area for users to paste their function code.
- Button to analyze and estimate the time complexity.
- Displays the estimated time complexity in a clean and minimal UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Backend framework to handle requests and render templates.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the frontend UI design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
